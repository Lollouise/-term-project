    <h2>My cheerleading history</h2>
   <p>My cheerleading journey started all the way back in 2008. 
       My mom had seen that our local gymnastics gym was going to start a cheerleading team.
       However it seemed very uncertain if they would actually become an established team and compete,
       so my mom quite quickly found an actual cheerleading gym that I moved to.
       That gym was Dynamite Cheerleading and I started in one of their training teams.
       But after only one season I got moved on to a competition team, and the rest is history.
    </p>
   <p>No but I was very quickly captured by the sport and today I don't know what my life would be like without it.
       However it wasn't all a dance on roses, I didn't make progress as fast as it seemed like other people did.
       Especially when it came to tumbling, I just didn't understand it and I was admittedly scared.
       After a few years of not really leveling up, many times because of my lack of tumbling, I started to become a bit discouraged.
       But the Twisters Cheer Elite came into my life through a camp I attended and I decided to switch to their gym.
       There I actually started to progress in my tumbling for the first time.
       However I was still not on the same level as a lot of other people.
       But with a refound passion I started to focus a lot on the stunting part instead.
       I figured if I got really really good at stunting it could make up for what I lacked in tumbling.
       It took a while but eventually it did work.
       The last few years I have competed on teams in the highest levels there are in cheerleading.
       But I still have goals and a want to be a part of something bigger.
       I loved my team and gym but if I was going to achieve those things I would have to leave.
       Something I've always wanted has been to be a part of Team Sweden, preferably All Girl but I would have been happy with coed too.
       But here my lack of tumbling became a problem again.
    </p> 
   <p>So I set my sights for a team across the sea.
       I tried out for Lady Lux and I actually made it!
       So I left home and moved to North Carolina.
       Doing a move like this hasn't been easy, but it has been so worth it.
       Since this is a team that doesn't tumble that is no longer a problem and I feel like I've finally had a place to thrive.
       I'm so happy, thankful and proud that my journey has taken me here.
       This team is more than "just a team", it's like a second family.
